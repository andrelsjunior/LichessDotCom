"""Step 2 of the Game Review's game rating calibration: fits, on extract.py's
output, how often a player of each rating loses how much win% on a move, and
writes it into src/page/review/rating/model.json.

Needs numpy and scipy:

  python3 tools/game-rating/fit.py moves.jsonl && pnpm format

The model, per speed: a move falls in one of the review's loss bands (best,
excellent, good, inaccuracy, mistake, blunder), with odds that depend on the
player's rating, the phase the move was played in (opening, tactics,
strategy, endgame) and whether the mover was lost, level or winning (in a
won position even a big blunder costs little win%). A game's moves make a
likelihood over the level it was played at, and that level is drawn around
the player's rating, with a width (tau) fitted on held-out games: the
posterior's mean is the game rating. Without a rating (an anonymous player),
the population is the prior. src/page/review/rating/model.ts reads it.
