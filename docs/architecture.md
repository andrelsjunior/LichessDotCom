# Architecture and conventions

## The three scripts

A Lichess tab runs two scripts of ours, in two JavaScript worlds that share
only the DOM and `window.postMessage`. A third runs in the background.

| Script                       | Source                        | Can reach                                             | Can't reach                                         |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `content.js` + `content.css` | `src/content/`, `src/styles/` | the extension's files and APIs (`chrome.*`)           | Lichess's objects (`site`, the analysis controller) |
| `page.js`                    | `src/page/`                   | Lichess's objects, its sound player, its translations | the extension's APIs                                |
| `background.js`              | `src/background/`             | the extension's APIs                                  | any page                                            |

`src/shared/` holds what several of them use: DOM and markup helpers, the
messages between the worlds (`protocol.ts`), storage keys, chess basics. It
must not touch `chrome.*`: the page world would crash on it. Each directory
has its own `tsconfig.json`, so a page-world file that names `chrome` fails
to type-check, and the linter says why.

`src/manifest.ts` defines the manifest for every target (Chrome, the Chrome
Web Store, Firefox). `scripts/build.ts` bundles each script with rolldown into
an IIFE, joins the stylesheets, copies `public/` and writes the manifest into
`dist/<target>/`.

## Features

Each world's `index.ts` lists its features in the order they start. A feature
is a module exporting a `Feature` (`src/shared/features.ts`): a name and a
`start()`. One that throws is logged and the others still start.

Content features that follow the page as Lichess redraws it register a task
with `onEveryTick` (`src/content/sync-loop.ts`): one 250 ms interval runs them
all, in registration order. A task must cost next to nothing when there's
nothing to do.

A feature's folder splits what it does into small modules: pure logic
(parsing, geometry, text, classification) apart from what touches the DOM,
so the logic can be unit-tested without a page.

## Types

- No `any`, no type assertion of any kind (`as`, `<T>x`, `!`), no const
  assertion either: annotate the type, or narrow it. Lint and
  `scripts/check-sources.ts` enforce it.
- Data from outside (JSON, `postMessage`, storage, Lichess's API) is parsed
  with a [zod/mini](https://zod.dev/packages/mini) schema, and its type is
  `z.infer` of that schema, never written by hand. Use `parseJson`,
  `readStored` / `readStoredJson`.
- Lichess's live objects (the analysis controller, tree nodes, the sound
  player) must keep their identity, and a zod parse returns a copy: narrow
  them with `createGuard(schema)` instead (`src/shared/guards.ts`). The
  schema still gives the type. Describe only the members we use.
- DOM lookups narrow with `instanceof` through `queryOne`, `queryAll` and
  `closestTo` (`src/shared/dom.ts`).
- Import with the `.ts` extension, and `import type` for types only.

## Code

- **Names say what things are**: `square`, `whiteShare`, `moveTimes`, not
  `sq`, `ws`, `mt`. Single letters only for loop indexes (`i`, `j`, `k`),
  coordinates (`x`, `y`) and type parameters.
- **Comments are short and say why**, the way a colleague would: a Lichess
  quirk, a browser pitfall, a reason a simpler way doesn't work. No comment
  that repeats the code, no essay. One or two lines is the norm; a module
  may open with a few lines on what it's for.
- **Small pieces**: at most 250 lines of code per file and 60 per function,
  four parameters (take an options object beyond that), complexity 15, no
  nested ternaries. Split along what the code does, not by line count.
- **Markup built as text** goes through the `html` tagged template
  (`src/shared/html.ts`): every interpolated value is escaped unless it's
  `html` output itself. `trustedHtml` is for constants only.
- **Never move or remove Lichess's DOM nodes**: it renders with snabbdom,
  which breaks if its nodes move. Add ours (`cdc-` prefixed) beside them,
  set attributes, and let CSS rearrange.
- **Write only what changes**: `setData` and `setStyleProperty` skip
  unchanged values, as every write wakes the page's observers. Prefer
  `classList.toggle(name, force)` to `add`, which writes even when the class
  is there.
- Everything of ours (classes, ids, data attributes, CSS variables, storage
  keys) starts with `cdc`. Storage keys live in `StorageKey` / `SessionKey`.

## Styles

`src/styles/index.css` imports each page's stylesheet in cascade order; a
stylesheet longer than 400 lines is a folder of partials with its own
`index.css`. The build inlines the imports, byte for byte, into
`content.css`. Content-script CSS loses ties with Lichess's, hence the many
`!important`s; scope every rule to its page (`main.round …`).

## Tests

- Unit tests sit next to the code (`foo.test.ts`), run by vitest in
  happy-dom. Test the logic through its exports; for the DOM parts, build
  the markup Lichess serves and check what we add.
- Code ported from the original scripts is checked against what they
  produced: `fixtures/legacy*.json` holds outputs recorded from the
  original for representative inputs (see the radar's test).
- End-to-end tests (`tests/e2e`) load `dist/chrome` into Playwright's
  Chromium and drive live lichess.org pages.
