![LichessDotCom: Lichess, the look you know](store/promo-marquee.png)

Lichess is free, open source and has no ads. This Chrome extension gives it
the look and feel most players are used to: a green board, modern pieces,
familiar sounds, a roomy layout and a Game Review after every game.

Your Lichess account, your games and your friends don't change. Only the look
and the sounds do.

## What you get

### The look you know

The green board and the Neo pieces, a sidebar on the left, player bars with
the clocks above and below the board, and one panel on the right for the moves
and the chat. A game fits on your screen, so there's nothing to scroll.

### A Game Review for every game

Open any finished game and you get a full review: each player's accuracy, a
rating for how well they played, and every move marked brilliant, great, best,
mistake, blunder… A coach then takes you through the game move by move.

The engine runs on your own computer, so it's free and there's no daily limit.

### Your board, your pieces

37 boards and 40 piece sets, the ones you know, or Lichess's own if you'd
rather keep them. Pick them in the settings menu, at the bottom of the
sidebar.

### The rest of the site too

Home, puzzles, lessons, profiles, tournaments, the forum: every page gets the
same treatment.

## Install it

If you want to install it directly from GitHub:

1. Download `LichessDotCom-v….zip` from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/theophile-wallez/LichessDotCom/releases/latest)
   and unzip it into a folder you'll keep.
2. In Chrome, open `chrome://extensions`.
3. Turn on **Developer mode**, top right.
4. Click **Load unpacked** and choose the unzipped folder (the one with
   `manifest.json` in it).
5. Open [lichess.org](https://lichess.org).

It also works in Edge, Brave, Arc, Opera and Vivaldi: the steps are the same,
from their own extensions page. Safari isn't supported.

### In Firefox

Firefox 140 or later. It has its own package:

1. Download `LichessDotCom-v…-firefox.zip` from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/theophile-wallez/LichessDotCom/releases/latest).
2. In Firefox, open `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
3. Click **Load Temporary Add-on…** and choose the ZIP.
4. Open [lichess.org](https://lichess.org).

Firefox only keeps an extension it hasn't had signed by Mozilla until you quit
it: load it again after a restart.

Leave the folder where it is: the browser loads the extension from it, so
moving or deleting it removes the extension.

**To update**, download the new release's ZIP and replace the folder's files with the
new ones. The extension reloads on its own the next time you go back to a
Lichess tab.

**To remove it**, click **Remove** on its card in `chrome://extensions`.

## Good to know

- It's made for computers. In a narrow window or on a tablet you get Lichess's
  usual mobile layout, with the new colors, board and pieces.
- Its sounds and images come with it: it loads nothing from other sites.
- Nothing is tracked or collected.

## Development

The extension is written in TypeScript and bundled with
[rolldown](https://rolldown.rs). You need Node.js 24 and pnpm
(`corepack enable` installs the version the repository pins).

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev    # builds dist/chrome, then again on every change
```

Load `dist/chrome` with **Load unpacked** in `chrome://extensions`. It reloads
itself when you go back to a Lichess tab after a rebuild.

`pnpm check` runs the type checks, the linter, the formatting check and the
unit tests, and `pnpm test:e2e` the end-to-end tests on lichess.org (after
`pnpm build`). How the code is organized:
[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

### Building from the sources

Each version sent to Firefox Add-ons comes with the sources it's built from,
`LichessDotCom-v<version>-source.zip`. To rebuild the add-on from them, with
Node.js 24 and pnpm, in the unzipped folder:

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm build --target firefox --release --version <version>
```

`dist/firefox` is then the add-on, file for file. From a clone at the tag
`store-<version>`, `pnpm package` writes every package into `dist/`.

## Disclaimer

This is a free, personal fan project, made for fun. It isn't sold, it shows
no ads, it asks for no money, and it's not meant to make money in any way.

It isn't affiliated with, endorsed by or sponsored by Lichess or any other
chess site or company. All names, trademarks, logos, images, pieces, boards and
sounds belong to their respective owners, and are used here only to change how
lichess.org looks on your own computer. No ownership of them is claimed.

If you own something used here and want it gone, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/theophile-wallez/LichessDotCom/issues) and it will be removed promptly.

The extension only changes how Lichess looks and sounds in your browser. It
doesn't touch your account, and it gives no help during a game you're
playing: using an engine in a live game breaks Lichess's rules, so don't.

It comes as is, with no warranty of any kind. A Lichess update can break it
at any time. You use it at your own risk, and the author can't be held
responsible for any problem that comes from using it. See the
